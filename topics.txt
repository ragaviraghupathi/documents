why react?
 1)Lightweigt:can be used on legacy apps.
 2)Stability:the components that are created in much earlier versions of React will likely continue to work today with 
very minimal tweaks.

jest:
Jest is a JavaScript testing framework designed to ensure correctness of any JavaScript codebase. It allows you to write 
tests with an approachable, familiar and feature-rich API that gives you results quickly. Jest is well-documented,
 requires little configuration and can be extended to match your requirements.”

Testing Library:
“the Testing Library family of libraries is a very light-weight solution for testing without all the implementation 
details. The main utilities it provides involve querying for nodes similarly to how users would find them. In this way, 
testing-library helps ensure your tests give you confidence in your UI code.” Their philosophy is that “the more your 
tests resemble the way your software is used, the more confidence they can give you”.

Cypress:
Cypress is an end-to-end (e2e) “test runner built for humans”, with tests that “are easy to read and understand” and can 
be run in your browser and “run as fast as your browser can render”. Finally, Cypress provides “readable error messages 
[that] help you to debug quickly”

Jest and Testing Library are typically what you might refer to as Unit Testing and Integration Testing libraries, whereas
 Cypress is typically used for End-To-End (e2e) testing.
This means that you would test your application from start to finish, as if you were a user using your application 
(with all the clicks and page navigations included and so on).
